# 🚀 Shadowsocks Rust Server Launcher

This repository contains a bash script to **automatically deploy the latest [Shadowsocks-Rust](https://github.com/shadowsocks/shadowsocks-rust)** server using Docker.

---

## 📦 What It Does

- Pulls the latest `ssserver-rust` Docker image from GitHub Container Registry.
- Removes any existing container with the same name.
- Starts a new container named `ssserver-rust` with `--restart always`.
- Mounts your local `config.json` to the container's configuration path.
- Maps ports `8388/tcp` and `8388/udp` for Shadowsocks traffic.

---

## 📝 Prerequisites

- A Linux VPS with:
  - Docker installed
  - This script and a valid `config.json` file in the same directory

---

## 🛠 Usage

1. Place your valid `config.json` next to this script.

2. Make the script executable:

   ```bash
   chmod +x run_ssserver.sh
````

3. Run the script:

   ```bash
   ./run_ssserver.sh
   ```

> The script will clean up any existing `ssserver-rust` container and launch a new one.

---

## 🔐 Security Note

* Be sure your `config.json` does **not expose an open port without proper encryption or password**.
* Consider configuring firewall rules to allow only known IP ranges.

---

## 🧹 To Stop and Remove the Server

```bash
docker stop ssserver-rust
docker rm ssserver-rust
```
